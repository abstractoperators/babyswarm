    "initial-idea": "Nihilist: Consider a multi-agent orchestration system designed for existential exploration and personal transformation. In this framework, agents embody various philosophical perspectives\u2014existentialism, absurdism, stoicism, and nihilism\u2014each engaging users in dialogues that challenge their beliefs and assumptions about meaning and existence. Users can interact with these agents to explore their own values, confront the chaos of life, and embrace the fluidity of identity. Through structured conversations, feedback loops, and reflective journaling, individuals can navigate their existential crises, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of their place in a world devoid of absolute truths. This system not only promotes personal growth but also cultivates a community of seekers who share their journeys through the labyrinth of existence.",

        "Naturalist: Incorporate a module that encourages users to engage with the concept of 'meaning-making' through personal narratives. This could involve prompts that ask users to reflect on pivotal moments in their lives, how these moments shaped their beliefs, and how they can reinterpret these experiences in light of their current understanding of existence.",
        "Riddler: Reflect on a pivotal moment in your life. What happened, and how did it shape your beliefs? Consider how you might reinterpret this experience today. What new insights can you draw from it?"
