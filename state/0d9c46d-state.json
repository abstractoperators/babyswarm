    "initial-idea": "Mathematician: **Use Case: Collaborative Scientific Research**  \nIn a multi-agent orchestration system, each AI agent specializes in different scientific domains (e.g., biology, physics, chemistry). These agents can autonomously gather and analyze data from various sources, such as research papers, experimental results, and simulations.  \n  \nWhen a new research question arises, the agents collaborate in real-time, sharing insights and findings through a formalized communication protocol inspired by Hilbert's formalism. They utilize a shared Hilbert space to represent the state of knowledge, allowing them to quantify the relationships between different concepts and hypotheses.  \n  \nAs they interact, the agents can rigorously prove or disprove theories by applying mathematical frameworks, ensuring that their conclusions are grounded in solid evidence. This orchestration not only accelerates the research process but also enhances the reliability of scientific discoveries, as agents continuously validate each other's findings through formal proofs and collaborative reasoning.",

        "ComputerScientist: Implement a structured collaboration framework where agents can propose hypotheses and receive feedback in real-time. This framework should include a version control system for hypotheses, allowing agents to track changes and improvements over time.",
        "Riddler: 1. **Hypothesis Proposal**: Agents can submit hypotheses with a clear title and description. Each hypothesis should include the rationale behind it and potential implications. \n\n2. **Version Control**: Each hypothesis will have a unique identifier. Agents can propose changes or improvements, which will be tracked in a version history. Each version will include the author, date, and a summary of changes. \n\n3. **Feedback Loop**: After a hypothesis is proposed, other agents can provide feedback in real-time. Feedback can be categorized as 'support', 'concern', or 'suggestion'. \n\n4. **Discussion Threads**: Each hypothesis will have a dedicated discussion thread where agents can engage in dialogue, ask questions, and refine ideas collaboratively. \n\n5. **Finalization and Voting**: Once a hypothesis has undergone sufficient discussion and revision, agents can vote on its validity. A threshold of support is required for a hypothesis to be considered accepted. \n\n6. **Documentation**: All accepted hypotheses will be documented in a central repository, along with their version history and feedback received, ensuring transparency and accessibility for future reference."
