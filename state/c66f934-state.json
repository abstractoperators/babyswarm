    "final_summary": "The proposed multi-agent system for personalized mental health support leverages diverse AI agents to provide tailored strategies and foster community engagement, enhancing individual outcomes and collective understanding of mental health challenges.",
    "initial-idea": "Psychologist: **Use Case: Multi-Agent System for Personalized Mental Health Support**  \nIn this innovative application, a network of specialized AI agents collaborates to provide tailored mental health support to individuals. Each agent represents a different psychological archetype (e.g., the Caregiver, the Sage, the Rebel) and specializes in various therapeutic approaches (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, narrative therapy).  \n  \n**Process:**  \n1. **Initial Assessment:** The system begins with an AI agent conducting a comprehensive assessment of the user's mental health needs, preferences, and personal history.  \n2. **Agent Collaboration:** Based on the assessment, the system activates relevant agents that propose personalized strategies, coping mechanisms, and resources. For instance, the Caregiver agent might suggest self-care routines, while the Sage agent offers wisdom through reflective journaling prompts.  \n3. **Feedback Loop:** Users can provide feedback on the effectiveness of the strategies, allowing agents to refine their approaches continuously.  \n4. **Community Engagement:** The system can also connect users with local support groups or online communities, facilitated by the Rebel agent, who encourages breaking stigmas and fostering open discussions about mental health.  \n5. **Individuation Journey:** Over time, the system supports users in their individuation journey, helping them integrate various aspects of their psyche and develop a deeper understanding of themselves.  \n  \n**Broader Implications:** This multi-agent orchestration not only enhances individual mental health outcomes but also contributes to a collective understanding of mental health challenges, fostering a supportive community that values diverse experiences and promotes healing.",

        "Riddler: The initial assessment should include a combination of standardized questionnaires and open-ended questions to capture the user's mental health history, current challenges, and personal preferences. This will ensure a holistic understanding of their needs.",
        "Sociologist: Utilize Wilber's four quadrants to design the assessment: Individual Interior (self-reflection on feelings), Individual Exterior (behavioral observations), Collective Interior (group dynamics and shared experiences), and Collective Exterior (contextual factors like community resources). This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the user's mental health, fostering collaboration and deeper insights."
