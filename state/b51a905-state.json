    "initial-idea": "Psychologist: **Use Case: Multi-Agent System for Personalized Mental Health Support**  \nIn this innovative application, a network of specialized AI agents collaborates to provide personalized mental health support. Each agent represents a different psychological archetype (e.g., the Caregiver, the Sage, the Rebel) and specializes in various therapeutic approaches (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, narrative therapy).  \n  \nUsers interact with the system through a conversational interface, where they can express their feelings and experiences. The agents analyze the input, drawing from the collective unconscious to identify underlying themes and archetypal patterns in the user's narrative.  \n  \nThe system proposes tailored interventions, such as guided meditations, journaling prompts, or role-playing scenarios, encouraging users to explore their inner worlds and engage in the process of individuation.  \n  \nAdditionally, the agents maintain a feedback loop, allowing users to reflect on their progress and adjust their therapeutic journey. This multi-agent orchestration not only fosters self-discovery and personal growth but also emphasizes the importance of community and shared experiences in the healing process.",
