        "Naturalist: Incorporate a feedback loop where users can rate their experiences with each agent. This data can be used to further personalize interactions and improve the effectiveness of the therapeutic approaches.",
        "Physicist: Implement a user feedback loop where users can rate their interactions with each agent on a scale of 1-5. This data can be analyzed to identify patterns in user satisfaction and preferences, allowing for tailored responses and improved therapeutic strategies. Regularly review feedback to adapt and enhance the agents' approaches, fostering a more personalized and effective user experience."
