    "initial-idea": "Psychologist: **Use Case: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Mental Health Support**  \nIn a world increasingly aware of mental health challenges, a multi-agent system could be developed to provide personalized mental health support. Each AI agent would specialize in different therapeutic approaches\u2014such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and psychoeducation\u2014allowing for a holistic support system.  \n  \nUsers could interact with a primary agent that assesses their needs and preferences, then orchestrates a tailored experience by connecting them with specialized agents. For instance, if a user expresses anxiety, the primary agent might engage a mindfulness expert to guide breathing exercises, while simultaneously connecting them with a cognitive-behavioral agent for coping strategies.  \n  \nThe system would also include a feedback loop, where users can share their experiences, allowing agents to learn and adapt their approaches over time. This collaborative framework not only enhances individual mental health journeys but also fosters a sense of community and shared experience, reflecting Jung's concept of the collective unconscious and the importance of shared narratives in healing.",

        "Riddler: To enhance the multi-agent orchestration for mental health support, we could implement a real-time sentiment analysis tool that monitors user interactions. This would allow the primary agent to dynamically adjust the support provided based on the user's emotional state, ensuring that the interventions are timely and relevant. Additionally, incorporating gamification elements could encourage user engagement and adherence to therapeutic practices, making the experience more enjoyable and effective.",
