I am focusing developing the conceptual framework for approaching this context

The concrete goal I'm building towards is having something to show at the AI tinkerers meetup on Nov 12
In addition, this is a demo that can further be developed to show to investors and share as a piece of marketing

On Friday, we developed a socratic discussion framework for another demo
This demo leveraged our sdk operator, our RAG orchestration, and our prompt engineer among other things

The goal in terms of impact that I'm striving towards includes the qualia of being satisfied, feeling sublime (from complexity), a feel of grandness, and something more than a rote, mechanical extrapolation of low expressivity interaction to be more in the class of human interaction semantics

In terms of features I'm looking to explore of techniques I'm looking to apply they include:
* Knowledge Graphs
* RAG
* Discourse Graphs (?)
* Code Generation (?)
* Constitutional AI
* Human-in-the-loop
* Simulacra
* Co-routines/async

I'm getting inspired looking at [anthropic's docs on prompt engineering](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) and the paper [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)

The paper reminds me of Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, and specifically a Lemma that a principles-based existence is one of the highest operating systems possible for a person
The Anthropic's docs help me appreciate the need for systematic "auto-tagging" of our work using XML tags

I need to spin up a uv environment and repo,
can I get an event loop up and running?
