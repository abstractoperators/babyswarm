I am focusing developing the conceptual framework for approaching this context

The concrete goal I'm building towards is having something to show at the AI tinkerers meetup on Nov 12
In addition, this is a demo that can further be developed to show to investors and share as a piece of marketing

On Friday, we developed a socratic discussion framework for another demo
This demo leveraged our sdk operator, our RAG orchestration, and our prompt engineer among other things

The goal in terms of impact that I'm striving towards includes the qualia of being satisfied, feeling sublime (from complexity), a feel of grandness, and something more than a rote, mechanical extrapolation of low expressivity interaction to be more in the class of human interaction semantics

In terms of features I'm looking to explore of techniques I'm looking to apply they include:
* Knowledge Graphs
* RAG
* Discourse Graphs (?)
* Code Generation (?)
* Constitutional AI
* Human-in-the-loop
* Simulacra
* Co-routines/async

I'm getting inspired looking at [anthropic's docs on prompt engineering](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts) and the paper [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)

The paper reminds me of Ken Wilber's Integral Theory, and specifically a Lemma that a principles-based existence is one of the highest operating systems possible for a person
The Anthropic's docs help me appreciate the need for systematic "auto-tagging" of our work using XML tags

I need to spin up a uv environment and repo,
can I get an event loop up and running?

I went deep into looking at research papers.

I realize personally I'd like to be more attune to what's happening in the scientific community
This, in fact, is the only source of edge in our company

We as an engineering organization need to be at the forefront of applying communicated advancements in our chosen area of expertise

For this project, I listed out some techniques I'm interested to apply
I think instead I am changing my orientation to specifically apply the "canon" papers of multi-agent architectures

At the same time, I want a best in class implementation of a single agent architecture

The project overall now should be scientifically grounded

I can take an "inductive" approach. Start from a baseline, baby implementation of agent-agent interaction, and scale it up the ladder of abstraction
