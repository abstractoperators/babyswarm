## Features

Cycles + Workflows
* Protocols

Memories
* Shared memory access
* In-context and retrieved memory

Role-based Agents

Tool-Use

## Limitations
* no (robust) RAG
* not performant

## Protocol
1. Assemble diverse groups
  * two groups of 3 randomly selected
2. (In-parallel) generate ideas
  * Andy and Michael can veto
  * If everything is veto'd start over
3. Choose an idea
  * kent chooses if there's two ideas
4. Develop the idea
  * develop eng
  * develop design
5. Synthesize and summarize
6. Repeat

Continuously evaluate goodness and coherency of the idea
